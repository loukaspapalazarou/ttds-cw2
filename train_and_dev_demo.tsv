OT	In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
OT	The earth was without form, and void; and darkness was on the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.
OT	Then God said, "Let there be light"; and there was light.
OT	And God saw the light, that it was good; and God divided the light from the darkness.
OT	God called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night. So the evening and the morning were the first day.
OT	Thus God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament; and it was so.
OT	And God called the firmament Heaven. So the evening and the morning were the second day.
OT	Then God said, "Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear"; and it was so.
OT	And God called the dry land Earth, and the gathering together of the waters He called Seas. And God saw that it was good.
OT	Then God said, "Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb that yields seed, and the fruit tree that yields fruit according to its kind, whose seed is in itself, on the earth"; and it was so.
OT	And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he tore his clothes, and said, "Alas, my daughter! You have brought me very low! You are among those who trouble me! For I have given my word to the LORD, and I cannot go back on it."
OT	So she said to him, "My father, if you have given your word to the LORD, do to me according to what has gone out of your mouth, because the LORD has avenged you of your enemies, the people of Ammon."
OT	Then she said to her father, "Let this thing be done for me: let me alone for two months, that I may go and wander on the mountains and bewail my virginity, my friends and I."
OT	So he said, "Go." And he sent her away for two months; and she went with her friends, and bewailed her virginity on the mountains.
OT	And it was so at the end of two months that she returned to her father, and he carried out his vow with her which he had vowed. She knew no man. And it became a custom in Israel
OT	that the daughters of Israel went four days each year to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite.
OT	Then the men of Ephraim gathered together, crossed over toward Zaphon, and said to Jephthah, "Why did you cross over to fight against the people of Ammon, and did not call us to go with you? We will burn your house down on you with fire!"
OT	And Jephthah said to them, "My people and I were in a great struggle with the people of Ammon; and when I called you, you did not deliver me out of their hands.
OT	So when I saw that you would not deliver me, I took my life in my hands and crossed over against the people of Ammon; and the LORD delivered them into my hand. Why then have you come up to me this day to fight against me?"
OT	Now Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead and fought against Ephraim. And the men of Gilead defeated Ephraim, because they said, "You Gileadites are fugitives of Ephraim among the Ephraimites and among the Manassites."
OT	The Gileadites seized the fords of the Jordan before the Ephraimites arrived. And when any Ephraimite who escaped said, "Let me cross over," the men of Gilead would say to him, "Are you an Ephraimite?" If he said, "No,"
OT	And Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then Jephthah the Gileadite died and was buried among the cities of Gilead.
OT	After him, Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel.
OT	He had thirty sons. And he gave away thirty daughters in marriage, and brought in thirty daughters from elsewhere for his sons. He judged Israel seven years.
OT	Then Ibzan died and was buried at Bethlehem.
OT	After him, Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel. He judged Israel ten years.
OT	And Elon the Zebulunite died and was buried at Aijalon in the country of Zebulun.
OT	After him, Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite judged Israel.
OT	He had forty sons and thirty grandsons, who rode on seventy young donkeys. He judged Israel eight years.
OT	Then Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the mountains of the Amalekites.
OT	Again the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and the LORD delivered them into the hand of the Philistines for forty years.
OT	And the Angel of the LORD appeared to the woman and said to her, "Indeed now, you are barren and have borne no children, but you shall conceive and bear a son.
OT	Now therefore, please be careful not to drink wine or similar drink, and not to eat anything unclean.
OT	And He said to me, "Behold, you shall conceive and bear a son. Now drink no wine or similar drink, nor eat anything unclean, for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb to the day of his death."'
OT	Then Manoah prayed to the LORD, and said, "O my Lord, please let the Man of God whom You sent come to us again and teach us what we shall do for the child who will be born."
OT	And God listened to the voice of Manoah, and the Angel of God came to the woman again as she was sitting in the field; but Manoah her husband was not with her.
OT	Then the woman ran in haste and told her husband, and said to him, "Look, the Man who came to me the other day has just now appeared to me!"
OT	So Manoah arose and followed his wife. When he came to the Man, he said to Him, "Are You the Man who spoke to this woman?" And He said, "I am."
OT	Manoah said, "Now let Your words come to pass! What will be the boy's rule of life, and his work?"
OT	So the Angel of the LORD said to Manoah, "Of all that I said to the woman let her be careful.
OT	She may not eat anything that comes from the vine, nor may she drink wine or similar drink, nor eat anything unclean. All that I commanded her let her observe."
OT	And the Angel of the LORD said to Manoah, "Though you detain Me, I will not eat your food. But if you offer a burnt offering, you must offer it to the LORD." (For Manoah did not know He was the Angel of the LORD.)
OT	Then Manoah said to the Angel of the LORD, "What is Your name, that when Your words come to pass we may honor You?"
OT	So Manoah took the young goat with the grain offering, and offered it upon the rock to the LORD. And He did a wondrous thing while Manoah and his wife looked on--
NT	And the whole city was gathered together at the door.
NT	Then He healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons; and He did not allow the demons to speak, because they knew Him.
NT	Now in the morning, having risen a long while before daylight, He went out and departed to a solitary place; and there He prayed.
NT	And Simon and those who were with Him searched for Him.
NT	When they found Him, they said to Him, "Everyone is looking for You."
NT	But He said to them, "Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also, because for this purpose I have come forth."
NT	And He was preaching in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and casting out demons.
NT	Now a leper came to Him, imploring Him, kneeling down to Him and saying to Him, "If You are willing, You can make me clean."
NT	Then Jesus, moved with compassion, stretched out His hand and touched him, and said to him, "I am willing; be cleansed."
NT	As soon as He had spoken, immediately the leprosy left him, and he was cleansed.
NT	and said to him, "See that you say nothing to anyone; but go your way, show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing those things which Moses commanded, as a testimony to them."
NT	However, he went out and began to proclaim it freely, and to spread the matter, so that Jesus could no longer openly enter the city, but was outside in deserted places; and they came to Him from every direction.
NT	And again He entered Capernaum after some days, and it was heard that He was in the house.
NT	Immediately many gathered together, so that there was no longer room to receive them, not even near the door. And He preached the word to them.
NT	Then they came to Him, bringing a paralytic who was carried by four men.
NT	And when they could not come near Him because of the crowd, they uncovered the roof where He was. So when they had broken through, they let down the bed on which the paralytic was lying.
NT	When Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, "Son, your sins are forgiven you."
NT	And some of the scribes were sitting there and reasoning in their hearts,
NT	"Why does this Man speak blasphemies like this? Who can forgive sins but God alone?"
NT	Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, "Your sins are forgiven you,' or to say, "Arise, take up your bed and walk'?
NT	But that you may know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins"--He said to the paralytic,
NT	"I say to you, arise, take up your bed, and go to your house."
NT	Immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went out in the presence of them all, so that all were amazed and glorified God, saying, "We never saw anything like this!"
NT	Then He went out again by the sea; and all the multitude came to Him, and He taught them.
NT	As He passed by, He saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax office. And He said to him, "Follow Me." So he arose and followed Him.
NT	Now it happened, as He was dining in Levi's house, that many tax collectors and sinners also sat together with Jesus and His disciples; for there were many, and they followed Him.
NT	And when the scribes and Pharisees saw Him eating with the tax collectors and sinners, they said to His disciples, "How is it that He eats and drinks with tax collectors and sinners?"
NT	When Jesus heard it, He said to them, "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance."
Quran	(Muhammad), such were the stories of the people who lived in (different) towns in the past. We had sent Our Messengers to them with (certain) miracles but the people still did not believe in what they had rejected before. Such is how God seals the hearts of the unbelievers.
Quran	We did not find many among them keeping their promises. However, We did find many evil-doers among them.
Quran	After the time of those people, We sent Moses with Our miracles to Pharaoh and his people, but they too rejected Our miracles. Consider, how terrible the end of the evil-doers is!
Quran	Moses told the Pharaoh, "I am a Messengers from the Lord of the Universe.
Quran	I must only speak what is true about God. I have brought you miracles from your Lord; therefore, let the children of Israel go free".
Quran	The Pharaoh asked Moses to show his miracles if he was telling the truth.
Quran	So Moses threw down his staff and suddenly it turned into a real serpent.
Quran	Then he uncovered his hand and it appeared sheer white to the onlookers.
Quran	Some of the Pharaoh's nobles considered him to be no more than a skillful magician
Quran	and said, "He wants to expel you from your land." They asked (others), " what is your opinion in the matter?
Quran	The others suggested holding Moses and his brother off and sending to all the cities
Quran	to bring together at the Pharaohs court all the skillful magicians.
Quran	The magicians came to the Pharaoh and said, "We must have our reward if we are to gain a victory over him (Moses)".
Quran	The magicians asked Moses, "Will you throw your staff first or shall we?"
Quran	He replied, "Throw yours first." Their great magic bewitched people's eyes and terrified them.
Quran	We inspired Moses to throw his staff, and suddenly it began to swallow-up all that the magicians had (falsely) invented.
Quran	Thus the Truth prevailed and their false art was banished.
Quran	The magicians who were defeated on the spot and were proved to be worthless,
Quran	threw themselves down in prostration
Quran	saying, "We declare our belief in the Lord of the Universe,
Quran	the Lord of Moses and Aaron."
Quran	The Pharaoh said to the magicians, "You declared your belief in him (Moses) without my permission. This is a plot to throw my people out of their city. But you will soon know.
Quran	I will cut off your hands and feet on the alternate sides and crucify you all."
Quran	The magicians said, "We will certainly return to Our Lord.
Quran	You only take revenge on us because we believed in the Lord when we saw His miracles. Lord, grant us patience and let us die Muslims (submitted to God)."
Quran	Some of the Pharaohs people said, "Will you let Moses and his people destroy the land and disregard you and your gods?" The Pharaoh said, "We will kill their sons and leave their women alive; they are under our domination."
Quran	Moses told his people to seek help from God and exercise patience. The earth belongs to Him and He has made it the heritage of whichever of His servants He chooses. The final victory is for the pious ones.
Quran	His people said, "We suffered a great deal before you came and we are still suffering even after you have come." Moses (tried to encourage them) by saying, "There is hope that your Lord will destroy your enemies and make you (their) successors in the land. So consider how you act."
Quran	For years We afflicted Pharaoh's people with shortages in food so that perhaps they would take heed.
Quran	But they would always ascribe their well-being to themselves and the misfortunes that they would experience to Moses and his people. Their fate is certainly in the hands of God but many of them do not know.
Quran	They said to Moses, "No matter what miracle you show to bewitch us, we will not believe you."
Quran	We sent upon them widespread calamities: floods of locusts, lice, frogs, and blood. All were distinct miracles but these criminals all the time remained proud.
Quran	When the torment would strike them, they would ask Moses, "Pray for us to your Lord through your covenant with Him. If He saves us from the torment, we shall certainly believe in you and permit you and the children of Israel to leave".
Quran	But when We relieved them from the torment for a given time, they again broke their promise.
Quran	We took revenge on them for their rejecting Our miracles, by drowning them in the sea, but they were not aware of (reality).
Quran	We gave the suppressed people the blessed eastern and western regions as their inheritance. Thus, the promises of your Lord to the children of Israel all came true because of the patience which they exercised. He destroyed all the establishments of the Pharaoh and his people.
